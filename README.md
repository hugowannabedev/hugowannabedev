- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @hugowannabedev, a DJ and music creator, entering the tech universre.
- I recently completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, where I acquired a good foundation in Java Script, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, Nodejs, Expressjs, Git, Mongodb, and Mongoose. 
- Iâ€™m currently doing another Full-Stack Web Developer course on Udemy.
- I am a beginner but I would love collaborate, learn from other developers and ultimately find a job as a dev.
